### Overview

This project was implemented during Spring 2020-2021 for Advanced Ray Tracing course. 
We first started with basic intersections and got simple images but after a while, we 
have studied more advanced techniques and our rendering results got a lot realistic.
I opened a repository in [github](https://github.com/yatiyr/AdvancedRayTracerCPU). And 
we also had to record our progress with blog posts.

<br/>

I first tried to implement this project with GLSL compute shaders but failed to follow
the homeworks on time. So when I saw that it was tackling my progress, I immediately
implemented a CPU version and carried on from there (This happened after 2nd Homework).

<br/>

At the end of the semester, I have a pet ray tracer as a programmer :D. I want to thank
to our professor **Ahmet Oğuz Akyüz** for this amazing course and also to my classmates 
(I've learnt a lot reading their blog posts).

Feature list:

- [x] Parallelism with C++ Async/Future
- [x] BVH trees for mesh intersections
- [x] Diffuse, Dielectric, Conductor materials
- [x] Multisampling
- [x] Motion Blur
- [x] Glossy Reflections
- [x] Depth Of Field
- [x] Texture support
- [x] Procedural Textures and Perlin Noise generator
- [x] Advanced Lighting (Directional, Point, Area, Environment, Spot lights)
- [x] HDR imaging and tone mapping
- [x] BRDF models
- [x] Object lights ( Light meshes and Light spheres)   
- [x] Path tracing support

During the course we recorded our progress with blog posts. Here are my blog posts in order;

I have learnt a lot with this project. It's not much but honest work :D. In the next blog post. I'll start explaining my journey. [Part 1](/blog/my-ray-tracer-journey-2) is about baby steps of
my pet ray tracer.
